# Keras Generation 1 Pokedex
A  convolutional neural network to identify Pok√©mon  
I was inspired by Adrian Rosebrock pokedex which only identified 5 pokemon.   I decided to try to create a pokedex that could identify any of the 150 pokemon.

## Dataset
I decided to use a kaggle dataset of only generation 1 pokemon (1-150) with each pokemon having at least 30 images. This was to provide the model with enough information so it could learn and make accurate prediction.
I also used the official pokemon site to retrieve the pokemon information
