# Keras Generation 1 Pokedex
### A  convolutional neural network to identify Pok√©mon  
I was inspired by Adrian Rosebrock pokedex which only identified 5 pokemon.   I decided to try to create a pokedex that could identify any of the 150 pokemon.

## Dataset
Kaggle dataset of only generation 1 pokemon (1-150) with each pokemon having at least 30 images was retrieved . This was to provide the model with enough information so it could learn and make accurate predictions. Then test set was created from the dataset by selecting a few random pokemon images.
The official pokemon site to retrieve the pokemon information of the identified pokemon.

## Method

### preprocessing
### Compiling
### Testing 
### Evaluating the model

### Webscraper

### Result

# Conclusion 
The model is able to identify pokemon but it lacking a bit with it accuracy which may be due to the model not having enough images to be trained.
